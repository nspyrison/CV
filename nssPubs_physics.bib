	abstract = {The incorporation of the Tunnel Diode Resonator ({TDR}) technique into an {ElectroStatic} Levitation ({ESL}) apparatus was explored. The {TDR} technique is known to operate and behave well at low temperatures with careful attention to coil-sample positioning in a dark, shielded environment. With these specifications a frequency resolution of 10-9 in a few seconds counting time can be achieved. {ootnotetextC}. V. Degrift, "Tunnel diode oscillator for 0.001 ppm measurements at low temperatures," Rev. Sci. Instrum. 46, 599 (1975). Complications arise when this technique is applied in the {ESL} chamber where a sample of molten metal is levitating less then 10 mm from the coil in a large electrostatic field. We have tested a variety of coils unconventional to {TDR}; including Helmholtz pairs and Archimedean spiral coils.},
