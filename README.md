Stale resume version. See `~/dropbox/resumes/LaTeX/*` for latest resume.

I cannot advise using the 'vitae' package from a win10 x64 on minimal TiNyTeX installation.
prohibitively time-consuming issues:
- subitems (_ie_ details of a job) 
- proper reference formatting (even with Rob's working example).
